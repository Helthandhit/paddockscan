# Put PaddockScan online from an Android phone

## 1. Create the repository

1. Open `github.com` in Chrome and sign in.
2. Tap **+** and choose **New repository**.
3. Name it `paddockscan-website`.
4. Set it to **Public** if you want free GitHub Pages hosting.
5. Do not add a README or other starter files.
6. Create the repository.

## 2. Upload the website

1. Extract `PaddockScan_Full_Website.zip` in Samsung My Files.
2. In the empty GitHub repository, choose **Add file → Upload files**.
3. Upload the contents of the extracted folder, not the outer folder itself.
4. Confirm that `index.html`, `styles.css`, `app.js`, `CNAME` and the `assets` folder are at the repository root.
5. Commit the upload.

GitHub's browser uploader may limit how many files can be selected at once. Upload the root files first, then open/create the `assets` folder and upload its files if necessary.

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open the repository **Settings**.
2. Open **Pages** under Code and automation.
3. Under Build and deployment, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
4. Select branch `main` and folder `/(root)`.
5. Tap **Save**.
6. GitHub will show the temporary address after deployment.

## 4. Connect paddockscan.com

The included `CNAME` file contains `paddockscan.com`.

At your domain provider, add GitHub Pages DNS records:

- Four `A` records for the root domain (`@`) using the current GitHub Pages IP addresses shown in GitHub's official custom-domain instructions.
- A `CNAME` record for `www` pointing to your GitHub Pages hostname, normally `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io`.

Then return to repository **Settings → Pages**, enter `paddockscan.com` under Custom domain and save it. Enable **Enforce HTTPS** after GitHub confirms the DNS.

## 5. Install the Owner Hub on Android

1. Open `https://paddockscan.com/#hub` in Chrome.
2. Open Chrome's menu.
3. Choose **Add to Home screen** or **Install app**.
4. The Hub will open like an Android app.

## Important

GitHub Pages hosts the website, but real shared sign-in and uploads require Firebase. Until Firebase is configured, the website clearly operates in local phone preview mode and data exists only on that browser.
